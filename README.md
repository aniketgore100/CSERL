Chef found a matrix A with N rows (numbered 1 through N) and M columns (numbered 1 through M), where for each row r and column c, the cell in row r and column c (denoted by (r,c)) contains an integer Ar,c.

This matrix has two interesting properties:

The integers in each row form a non-decreasing sequence, i.e. for each valid i, Ai,1≤Ai,2≤…≤Ai,M.
The integers in each column also form a non-decreasing sequence, i.e. for each valid j, A1,j≤A2,j≤…≤AN,j.
A K-worthy submatrix is a square submatrix of A, i.e. a submatrix with l rows and l columns, for any integer l, such that the average of all the integers in this submatrix is ≥K.

Chef wants you to find the number of K-worthy submatrices of A.
